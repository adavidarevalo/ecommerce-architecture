## ⚙️ AWS Setup Overview

1. **EC2 Instance**
   - Ubuntu or Amazon Linux
   - Node.js installed
   - Nginx configured to serve `/var/www/html`

2. **S3 Bucket**
   - Stores build artifacts generated by CodeBuild

3. **IAM Roles**
   - `CodeBuildRole`: Access to S3 and CodeDeploy
   - `CodeDeployRole`: Access to EC2 and S3
   - `EC2InstanceRole`: Attached to the instance for CodeDeploy agent

4. **CodePipeline Stages**
   - **Source** (GitHub)
   - **Build** (CodeBuild)
   - **Deploy** (CodeDeploy)

---

## 🚀 How to Deploy

### 1. Push Code to GitHub
Trigger the CI/CD pipeline by pushing to the `main` branch.

### 2. CodePipeline Runs
The pipeline will:
- Pull code from GitHub
- Build the React app via `buildspec.yml`
- Store artifacts in S3
- Deploy to EC2 using CodeDeploy

### 3. Visit the Live App
Navigate to the **public IP** of your EC2 instance.

---

## 🔐 Security Notes

- Only port 80 (HTTP) should be open to the public.
- Port 22 (SSH) should be limited to your IP.
- Use least-privilege IAM policies for each service role.

## 📄 Key Files

### `buildspec.yml`
Instructions for AWS CodeBuild to install, build, and output the project.

### `appspec.yml`
Defines how CodeDeploy will deploy the app on EC2.

### `scripts/install_dependencies.sh`
Installs Node, Nginx, and configures the environment.

### `scripts/start_server.sh`
Starts Nginx and places the built app in the appropriate directory.

## 🧪 Acceptance Criteria

- ✅ App builds successfully in CodeBuild
- ✅ Artifacts are stored in S3
- ✅ CodeDeploy completes without failure
- ✅ Application is accessible from EC2 public IP
- ✅ All services use secure IAM roles

## 💲 Cost Estimate

Running this project for 2–3 hours should cost around **$1 USD** using the AWS Free Tier and minimal instance sizes.
